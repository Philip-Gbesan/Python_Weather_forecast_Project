# Weather Prediction Flask App

This project predicts whether it will rain tomorrow using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM models.
It's a flask app project that predicts rainfall using three models and performs a comparison of their accuracies and then gets a general answer based on a subjective look at the output of all three models.

## Setup
